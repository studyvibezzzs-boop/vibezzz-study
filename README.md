### 🌸 Study & Vibe  
A tiny corner of the internet where I remind myself that growth isn’t loud — sometimes it’s just quiet tabs, soft colors, late-night coffee, and choosing to show up even when life feels messy. This project is my lil’ digital sanctuary: part motivation, part chaos, part “I’m trying fr.” It holds my study rhythms, my mental-health check-ins, my little affirmations, and all the energy that keeps me moving toward the version of me I’m tryna become. If you’re here, I hope you feel the same cozy spark — the one that whispers, “you got this, keep going.” ✨🤌🌿
